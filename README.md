# LocalStack and pytest

## Prerequisites

* Python 3+

Install the required pip packages for the project with:

    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

## Run Localstack

The easy way is to run LocalStack with docker-compose

Run the LocalStack container in the background with:
    
    $ docker-compose up -d

Follow the logs with: 

    $ docker logs -f localstack
    
Till you see:

```
...
Waiting for all LocalStack services to be ready
Ready.
```

## Run tests

A simple test that creates, invokes, and then tears down a simple Lambda is provided.

To run the test, use the following commands within the root of the project:

```
$ cd lambda/basic_lambda
$ pytest -s . 
```

Wait a while, you should see similar to the following:

```

LocalStack is set up to invoke Lambdas in separate docker containers with `lambci`:

```
$ docker ps -a
73da88af89c3        lambci/lambda:20191117-python3.6   "/var/lang/bin/pythoâ€¦"   5 seconds ago       Exited (0) 4 seconds ago                                                focused_newton

```

Check the container logs to see what you would in CloudWatch:
```
$ docker logs focused_newton

Congrats! You've run your first test against LocalStack!

To run a more complex test, repeat the above in `s3_lambda/`
